### Example (filled)

| Field             | Example Entry                                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title**         | “The Role of Mental Simulation in Human Planning”                       |
| **Core Question** | How do humans use mental simulation to plan future actions?             |
| **Main Idea**     | Humans plan by running internal forward models of action outcomes.      |
| **Approach**      | Behavioral experiments + computational modeling.                        |
| **Key Findings**  | Planning accuracy correlates with the fidelity of internal simulations. |
| **Insight**       | Supports the view of cognition as predictive simulation.                |
| **Limitations**   | Lab-based tasks; unclear neural implementation.                         |
| **Relations**     | Builds on predictive coding; connects to model-based RL.                |
| **Reflection**    | Suggests bridging human planning and AI world models.                   |
| **Tags**          | cognitive modeling, planning, simulation, prediction                    |

### Optional “3-Layer Mental Model”

If you want an even quicker mnemonic:

> **Q–A–I**
>
> * **Q:** What question is asked?
> * **A:** How is it answered?
> * **I:** What insight emerges?

Everything else (metadata, critique, connection) hangs off that spine.
